           <h2> These pictures above you indicates the anamosity that is driven within people who feel inferior toward black people, I personally feel like we should put a stop to this by incorporating black people into cartoon,tv showes as well as designer brands as these images of anyone of a colored decent would feel offended.</h2>
            
           <h3> Most people feel as brand such as H&amp;M,Gucci and Balenciaga should be a trend to boycott,but this'll only delay the invitable since, majority of people who like expensive brands might still end up buying these brands, therefore instead of boycotting these brands having black people espially anyone who would want to end racial trends to potientally stop the freedom brands have over consumer of from their products. </h3>
